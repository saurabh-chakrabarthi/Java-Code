/**
 * 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.
 *
 * Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
 * The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
 * There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 105
 * s consists of only uppercase English letters.
 * 0 <= k <= s.length
